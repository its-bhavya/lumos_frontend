## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Navy blue (#0A1D37) for buttons, headings, icons, and important text; evokes professionalism and focus.
- Background color: Powder blue (#BBD9FF) for section backgrounds and cards; provides a calm and unobtrusive base.
- Accent color: Light cyan (#9FE2BF) as an option for subtle highlights or active elements to make it significantly different from the primary in both brightness and saturation to create good contrast.
- Font pairing: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for body text and 'Playfair' (serif) for headlines; provides a balance of modern readability and classic elegance.
- Clean, minimalistic layout with smooth transitions and clear calls to action on every page.
- Cards are used extensively throughout the application for quizzes, options on the dashboard, uploaded resources, and result summaries, styled with rounded corners and slight shadows for depth.
- Subtle loading states and spinners to create a smooth user experience.
